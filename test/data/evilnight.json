That is 99% of the subreddits on this site, so it does work that way most of the time for most communities which is why people have faith in it.\n\nIn the popular subs, however, especially defaults, the spam comes in so fast and at such volume that it pushes everything else off the page before votes can get a chance to sort things out. Listentothis would average around 400 submissions per day without the bots automatically blocking around half that for being reposts, blacklisted spammers, or overly popular artists. \n\nOf the remaining 200, another 50 get whacked by the bots because we can't find the artist listed in external databases like musicbrainz, discogs, echonest, or last.fm - meaning they aren't career artists with a full album out yet. These get removed with a message to post in the melting pot thread. Hardly ideal, but there are so many bad faith actors we can't afford to make exceptions.

We'd have a lot less people voting if they had to go through that original slog of 400 posts. People get fed up with all the spam and move to smaller subreddits.\n\n---\n\nThe *ideal* solution is one I've been hassling admins about ever since they started talking to us again. Reddit needs the ability to create unique content tabs inside each sub. We hacked this in with CSS and search for the genres up at the top of the page, but a proper inbuilt system would be vastly more useful to people. \n\nWe could create a melting pot tab, a bestof tab, an asklistentothis tab, and a generic reject bin/tab. Rather than removing any posts, we could sort them into these categories automatically. Votes and reports could even control where things end up automatically using the bots. Then people here could *subscribe or ignore* each tab separately, allowing you to subscribe to a *subset* of any subreddit's content rather than all of it. That would revolutionize reddit and stop this bleedover into smaller subs that always happens.\n\nThis is not easy to do in code. The admins are looking into it, a lot of mods requested this during our little blackout campaign, but it's nowhere near a top priority at the moment. I'm also trying to get them to disable downvoting in listentothis as a trial run. It'd kill off a spammer's favorite tactic and stop any genre bigotry cold.\n\nIt'll be at least a year before any of this stuff can happen, obviously, but there is hope. ;)", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "curator", "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But if you trust in the reddit system you would realize that the good would float to the top regardless.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Common misconception - one I held myself and resisted giving up bitterly.

These get removed with a message to post in the melting pot thread. Hardly ideal, but there are so many bad faith actors we can&amp;#39;t afford to make exceptions. If something like this makes it through (due to a common band name in this instance) but it&amp;#39;s popular, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The votes do the best they can with the remaining 150 or so posts that make it past the gauntlet each day. We&amp;#39;d have a lot less people voting if they had to go through that original slog of 400 posts. People get fed up with all the spam and move to smaller subreddits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt; solution is one I&amp;#39;ve been hassling admins about ever since they started talking to us again. Reddit needs the ability to create unique content tabs inside each sub. We hacked this in with CSS and search for the genres up at the top of the page, but a proper inbuilt system would be vastly more useful to people. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could create a melting pot tab, a bestof tab, an asklistentothis tab, and a generic reject bin/tab. Rather than removing any posts, we could sort them into these categories automatically. Votes and reports could even control where things end up automatically using the bots. Then people here could &lt;em&gt;subscribe or ignore&lt;/em&gt; each tab separately, allowing you to subscribe to a &lt;em&gt;subset&lt;/em&gt; of any subreddit&amp;#39;s content rather than all of it. That would revolutionize reddit and stop this bleedover into smaller subs that always happens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is not easy to do in code. The admins are looking into it, a lot of mods requested this during our little blackout campaign, but it&amp;#39;s nowhere near a top priority at the moment. I&amp;#39;m also trying to get them to disable downvoting in listentothis as a trial run. It&amp;#39;d kill off a spammer&amp;#39;s favorite tactic and stop any genre bigotry cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll be at least a year before any of this stuff can happen, obviously, but there is hope. ;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "listentothis", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_ctr4h1b", "created": 1438703377.0, "author_flair_text": "moderator", "link_url": "https://soundcloud.com/tender-music/armour", "created_utc": 1438699777.0, "ups": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "link_title": "TIL J.R.R.
